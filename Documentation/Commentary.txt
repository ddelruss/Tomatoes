This file is an auxiliary commentary on the FreshTomatoes development project.
The -> marks indicate at what point I created a file in the project.
-> Commentary.txt

I begin by re-reading the requirements. Next, create a project structure that 
reflects the requirements: Client, Server, and Docs.
-> Requirements.txt
-> readme.txt

Next I want a high level architecture, in this case choosing the technologies.
This light-weight architecture step is a good time to validate assumptions about 
which technologies are current, play nice together, and suit the development team.
-> Architecture.txt

Next I want to get up and running with Node.js as my server software. I'll use a popular
tutorial to get started: http://www.tutorialspoint.com/nodejs/index.htm

I haven't used it on this machine before so I download and verify the installation. Since
my customer will need to do this, too, I begin documenting specific instructions.
-> Instructions.txt

For an API example I use a different tutorial:
https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2015/10/create-a-simple-restful-api-with-node-js/
-> files within Server folder

When I get to the routing phase I take a few minutes to design the RESTful API
-> API Design.txt

With the design sketched out I create the initial routes and get a feel for any issues.
